UWA Timetable is an Android app developed for easier organisation of timetable data from UWA's OLCR website. Its primary function is to display neatly a list of classes that a user has for the day, making it redundant to check the OLCR website everytime (or look at a screenshot etc).

This project is still largely a WIP, and I have also used it as a learning platform, so the code may not be as elegant as it could be. Any improvements are welcome, I will make sure to take a look at them when I have the time.
